# Form - Custom items

This example illustrates how to define items with [templates](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#template):

First item uses the embedded [dxTextBox](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTextBox/) editor with the capability to validate its value. Validation is implemented based on the syncronized [dxForm.validationGroup](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Configuration/#validationGroup) and [dxValidator.validationGroup](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxValidator/Configuration/#validationGroup). See also: [Data Validation](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Common/UI_Widgets/Data_Validation/), [Validate and Submit the Form](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Form/Validate_and_Submit_the_Form/).

Second item uses the static image.
